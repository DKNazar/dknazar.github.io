<h2 align="center">Preamble</h2>

High Dynamic Range (HDR) sounds very cool but what is it? After large amount of research I barely know, but it seems to work in the game for now. It is basically the wild west in HDR, we have some standards but often you can't rely on them, the screens do absurd things to emulate HDR for marketing, and all our assets are SDR.
