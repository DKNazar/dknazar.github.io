<h2 align="center">Preamble</h2>

We treat auto-exposure as multiplier on the raw lighting pass in our game, which can brighten or darken our scene. This is to emulate our eyes and cameras which adapt to different lighting environments, in a dark room we can see more after our eyes adjust. In terms of the game it makes your artist's life much easier when it comes to lighting their scenes. Especially useful for dynamic enviornments like day/night cycles and weather effects.
