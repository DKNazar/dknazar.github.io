Born in a peaceful origami village, play as a young star determined to create new enemies and tear them apart to prove themself the greatest Origami Ninja Star. As the self-appointed protector of your village, use your unfolding technique to switch between a nimble paper ball and a deadly paper star. Harness momentum as the Ball to traverse and ricochet through levels, then unleash it as the Star to strike enemies with precision.

Slice through your foes swiftly with fluid momentum-based combat. String together a deadly combination of rebounds, wall-climbs and shuriken strikes, with an arsenal of unique elemental powers to unleash on your enemies. Prove yourself the greatest against foes across every village.

<h2 align="center">Unique origami world</h2>

Enjoy every fold and scrunch of the paper world, each element inspired by real life origami art. Explore the woods, the clan dojos, city streets, and more in procedurally generated levels. Each run is unique in terms of visuals, enemies and upgrades. Meet characters, defeat enemies and face epic boss fights of all origami shapes and sizes.

Starting with a base set of combat and traversal abilities, enhance these through elemental upgrades found on each run. Unleash an exploding fire strike, wind shockwaves, lightning dash, and more. Combine these to face increasingly diverse and dangerous enemies each with their own fighting style.

<h1 align="center">Goals for Origami Ninja Star</h1>

Origami Ninja Star is a hybrid of ideas from action-adventure games we played while growing up. Combining aspects of 3D platforming, hack and slash combat, weird unique mechanics, and a meaningful but lighthearted story. While also adding in more modern aspects of games such as roguelike elements and procedural generation so our small team can reach a big scale. The game has gone through many iterations starting as a physics puzzle platform, moving to a combat focused early demo at PAX AUS 2019, and now an action-roguelike with procedurally generated levels.
