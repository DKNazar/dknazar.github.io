Origami Ninja Star is a chaotic hybrid of fast paced action and physics-based combat where YOU are the weapon. Slice into a colourful paper world where everyone is folded differently, and your destiny is to destroy everyone in your way. As the self-appointed protector of your village, use your unfolding technique to switch between a nimble paper ball and a deadly ninja star. Harness momentum as the Ball to traverse and ricochet through levels, then unleash it as the Star to strike enemies with precision.
